# Business Card HTML/CSS Project

This project involves creating a responsive business card using HTML and CSS. The business card will include a picture, a one-liner introduction, and links to your LinkedIn or GitHub accounts. The design will be customized using CSS, with additional functionality such as a border change on hover.

## Spicy
Add an animation to the business card using CSS. When a user hovers over the business card, the border of the card should change. You have creative freedom in deciding how the border changes.
